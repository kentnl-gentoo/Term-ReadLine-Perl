0.2: Test added.
0.3: Filehandles changed to \* from *, MinLine works, works with
debugger.
0.4: Some bugs with $| corrected. Application name is set. Works under
OS/2 without ReadKey. Should work under DOS with minimal changes (see
$inDOS in ReadLine/readline.pl).
0.5: Code to support ReadLine'less debugger moved to debugger. One
user reported that having .inputrc triggers the same bug that buggered
earlier versions of the package. Request for a second readline is
tried to be executed first, dying only if should work on a different terminal.
0.6: The above bug was due to missing vi keymap. Dirty workaround
added.
0.7: We made ReadMode on term_OUT ;-(
     Better workaround for return of globs from a sub.
     Word break chars more suitable for Perl.
0.8: Insert, Operate, HistorySearch added.
     Rudimental support for tk being active during ReadLine.
     Should work better if ReadKey is present, but did not bootstrap.
     SelfLoader (and AutoLoader) supported (uncomment the lines
	with SelfLoader, ISA, and __DATA__).
0.9: tkRunning corrected. New attributes in Features: getHistory,
	setHistory, and new methods: GetHistory and SetHistory.

After 0.9:
	Optional second argument to ->readline;
	[sg]etHistory, tkRunning features documented;
	Operate overwriting parameter fixed;
	AddHistory copied to addhistory in T::R::Perl;
	[SG]etHistory documented;
	tkRunning feature documented.
	eval "" => eval {}
	local => my
After 0.91:
	Couple of bugs with my $var = @_;
	use SelfLoader; moved to DATA.
	Works in XTERM on OS/2.
0.93:
	Updates to Operate, couple of keybindings added.
	$rl_completer_terminator_character, $rl_correct_sw added.
	Reload-init-file moved to C-x C-x.
	C-x ? and C-x * list/insert possible completions (similar to
		tcsh globbing).
	For a second ReadLine interface ReadLine::Stub is used (unsuccessfully)?
	C-x * moves cursor correctly.
0.94:
	Should work everywhere where stty works (possibly with a warning).
	Warning says where to find TRK, switchable off.
	ReadLine.pm removed from distribution.
0.95:
		(from Jim Meyering):
	* readline.pm (preinit): Recognize bash's `input-meta' as a
	valid variable name.
	(F_ReReadInitFile): Recognize key binding directives in which
	the double-quoted RHS contains white space.
	(rl_set): Treat bash's `visible-stats' as a synonym of
	CompleteAddsuffix.
	Workaround against Term::ReadKey::ReadMode returning undef
		(thanks to Helmut Jarausch).
0.96:
	tkRunning support unrolled, now needs newer Term/ReadLine.pm to use it.
	Warnings from inputrc come only if -w.
0.97:
	Wrong version of Perl.pm was included, did not work with older Perls.
0.98:
	newTTY added.
	ornaments added.
	no longer installs into PERL dirs.
	Name of interface is now Term::ReadLine::Perl.
	Meta-flag tolerated (thanks to Honza Pazdziora).
	Bindings to \C-letter work again.
0.99:
	Buglet with -w corrected.
0.9901:
	Support for ornaments busted editing of long lines.
0.9902:
	Do not test TRL::Gnu in test.pl!
	Allow control-? in assignments.  \M-\C- should work, as well as \x7F.
	(Thanks to Neil Bird!)
0.9903:
	Enable ornaments by default.
	Disable explicit ornaments in the test.pl.
0.9904: (thanks to Alexander Kourakos <awk@bnt.com>)
        gave warnings for blank lines in my .inputrc
        showed underlined spaces in prompts (in xterm) which look ugly.
0.9905: (thanks to Wilson P. Snyder II wsnyder@maker.com)
	Fix reverse search.
0.9906: $readline::rl_getc added with the default value \&readline::rl_getc
0.9907: remove defined() noise.
